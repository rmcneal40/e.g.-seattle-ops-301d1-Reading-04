What is Group Policy? Group Policy is a feature of Windows that facilitates a wide variety of advanced settings that network administrators can use to control the working environment of users and computer accounts in Active Directory. It essentially provides a centralized place for administrators to manage and configure operating systems, applications and users’ settings.

Group Policies, when used correctly, can enable you to increase the security of user’s computers and help defend against both insider threats and external attacks.

In this blog, we will go through a detailed explanation of what Group Policies and GPOs are, and how system administrators can use them to help prevent data breaches. A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a group of settings that are created using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Group Policy Editor. GPOs can be associated with a single or numerous Active Directory containers, including sites, domains, or organizational units (OUs). The MMC allows users to create GPOs that define registry-based policies, security options, software installation and much more.

Active Directory applies GPOs in the same, logical order; local policies, site policies, domain policies and OU policies.
